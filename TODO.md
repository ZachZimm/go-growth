**Perfomance**
- Send a smaller amount of data to the client by only sending the visible tiles plus a few extra as a buffer in each direction.

**Simulation / Gameplay**
- Change nutrient growth behaviour so we get more vine-like structures.

- Add an above-ground layer

- Add minerals that generate based on depth

- Add caverns to the generation

- Add some kind of drone that the player can interact with somehow.
    - Player can place the drone
    - Drone can mine resources and gather nutrients
    - Drones should be mostly autonomous, and I think most of the gameplay will be about achieving less obtuse methods of controlling them.
        - Eventually drones should be able to coordinate with each other to achieve more complex tasks which a single drone could not do alone.
                - Not sure what these tasks are yet

- Add some sort of 'hivemind' that leads the drones
    - Probably immobile with a nest growing around it through the work of the drones
